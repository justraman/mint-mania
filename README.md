# MintMania


## [mintmania.fun](https://mintmania.fun)

MintMania lets you create and trade ERC20 tokens on the Base blockchain. Inspired by Pump.fun on Solana, MintMania uses a bonding curve to manage token sales and liquidity. As tokens are bought and sold, their price adjusts according to the curve. Once the curve is fully utilized (reaches 100%), MintMania automatically adds liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX), making it easy for everyone to trade your token.
